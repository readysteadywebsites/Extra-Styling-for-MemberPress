== Description ==

Just a little plugin to make MemberPress registration and login pages look a little nicer. Allows easy styling of buttons, coupon buttons and registration notice right from the WordPress customizer.

Want even more customisation options? We have Pro version called [Missing Bits for MemberPress](https://readysteadywebsites.com/downloads/missing-bits-for-memberpress/)! You'll be able to do all the above + customize login screen width, widths of registration pages (which are a particular pain if you're using Divi), control the colours, paddings and styles of the fields on the login and registration forms independently, show/hide comments on memberships globally, loads of MemberPress Courses styling plus a whole load of other cool features!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does it work =

In order to see the styling in action, head over to 'MemberPress' in WordPress admin and then click on any of your Memberships and click 'View'. Then click 'Customize' in the WordPress admin bar at the top of the screen.

From there, choose 'MemberPress - Extra Styling' and you'll be able to play with the settings to get the right look for your buttons etc.

When you're done click 'Publish' in the customizer.
